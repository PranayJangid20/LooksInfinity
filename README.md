# looksinfinity

A Looks Infinity Ecommerce project.
- In August 2021, I created the "Looks Infinity" e-commerce app and released it on the Play Store.
- I took me around two months to finish the project, which involved database administration, UI/UX design, and e-commerce research and development.
- I didn't used Provider, Block, Cubit, CacheImage in this app.
- I used Firebase as the backend, which allowed me to manage authentication and store data.
- This project shows my early steps in my flutter development journey.
- I will like to publish it so other flutter enthusiasts can know that how to start their journey.

Note - This project is slightly differ from play store app as this code have some changes and bug fixes.
